# Cryptocurrency Wallet

This is a Streamlit application that allows a customer to interact with their Ethereum account, and hire a fintech professional through the KryptoJobs2Go platform.

The application allows the customer to generate a new Ethereum account instance by using their mnemonic seed phrase, fetch and display the account balance associated with their Ethereum account address, calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate for their work, digitally sign a transaction that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain. Finally, the customer can review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, first, navigate to the project folder that contains the **`.env`** file, **`krypto_jobs.py`** and **`crypto_wallet.py`** files. Activate your Conda **`dev`** environment if it is not already active. Then, launch the Streamlit application by typing streamlit run krypto_jobs.py in your terminal.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit
- Web3

You can install Streamlit and Web3 using the following command:

> pip install streamlit web3

## Project Structure

- **'krypto_jobs.py'**: This is the main script file that contains the Streamlit application code for the KryptoJobs2Go platform. The application allows the customer to interact with their Ethereum account and hire a fintech professional.
- **'crypto_wallet.py'**: This script file contains the Ethereum transaction functions that have been incorporated into Python functions, allowing the automation of the process of accessing them.
- **'.env'**: Contains the mnemonic seed phrase for the Ethereum account.

## Usage

To use the KryptoJobs2Go application, follow the steps outlined below:
